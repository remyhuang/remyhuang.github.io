We present a research project called __DJnet__, whose goal is to make a fully-automatic DJ using deep learning.
Toward this goal, we formuate and explore this project to several sub-topics.
* __Music Medley__ (compose a song from parts of existing pieces) [\[AAAI'18\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04384.pdf)
* __Music Mashup__ (blend two or more pre-recorded songs)
* __Music Thumbnailing__ (extract a short snippet that represents a whole song) [\[APSIPA'17\]](https://remyhuang.github.io/files/huang17apsipa.pdf) [\[ArXiv'18\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10495)
* __Electronic Dance Music Genre Classification__ (differentiate sub-genres of EDM)
* __Electronic Dance Music Generation__


We hope to let more people appreciate and dig deeper in DJ music through this project.
